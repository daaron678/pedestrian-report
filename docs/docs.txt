A pre-configured python environment with ArcGIS modules installed was set to be used by the ipykernel using
the command that followed:
"[path to my python environment]" -, ipykernel install --user --name [acrgispro-py3] --display-name "Python argis"
--> This will create a .json file (for Windows) in C:/Users/[user_name]/AppData/Roaming/jupyter/kernels/[project kernel]
that includes the location of the python environment to allow the ipykernel to connect to.
